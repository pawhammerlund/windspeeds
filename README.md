# windspeeds# 🌬️ Wind Speed Converter Web App

This is a responsive, interactive single-page web app that allows users to convert between different wind speed units—**knots**, **meters per second**, **kilometers per hour**, and **miles per hour**—and visually reference the corresponding **Beaufort Scale** level with descriptions.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Input wind speed in any unit and auto-convert to others
- ✅ Use a slider (0–80 knots) to adjust speed dynamically
- ✅ Highlights matching **Beaufort Scale** level based on current wind speed
- ✅ Clear, compact layout with wind condition descriptions for sailors
- ✅ Responsive design: works well on both desktop and mobile
- ✅ No dependencies — pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
